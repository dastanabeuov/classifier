      description: "According to international standards ISO 12006. 
      This is a platform that allows you to organize the classification 
      model of objects in the form of a tree structure (or hierarchy), and 
      provides nested relationships (ancestors, parent, root, children, siblings, 
      descendants), allowing you to retrieve all of them in one abstract SQL query."
